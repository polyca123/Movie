          </p>

          <p>Revenge of the Sith is set three years after the onset of the Clone Wars, established in Star Wars: Episode II – Attack
        of the Clones (2002). The Jedi are spread across the galaxy, leading a large-scale war against the Separatists.
        Following the death of Separatist leader Count Dooku, the Jedi Council dispatches Obi-Wan Kenobi to eliminate General
        Grievous, the head of the Separatist army, to put an end to the war. Meanwhile, after having premonitions of his wife
        Padmé Amidala dying in childbirth, Anakin Skywalker is tasked by the Council to spy on Palpatine, the Supreme Chancellor
        of the Galactic Republic and, secretly, a Sith lord known as Darth Sidious. Palpatine manipulates Anakin into turning to
        the dark side of the Force and becoming his apprentice, Darth Vader, with wide-ranging consequences for the galaxy.
